## üìä Data Source

The app uses 2024 NFL season statistics to project 2025 player performance. Data is loaded from `src/data/2024_FF_Stats.csv`.

## üéØ How It Works

### VBD Calculation
Value Based Drafting (VBD) compares each player's projected points to a baseline player at their position:
- QB: QB12 (worst starter in 12-team league)
- RB: RB24 (2 starters √ó 12 teams)
- WR: WR36 (3 starters √ó 12 teams)
- TE: TE12 (1 starter √ó 12 teams)

### Recommendation Engine
The AI considers multiple factors:
1. **VBD Score** - Higher value players score better
2. **Team Needs** - Critical positions get priority
3. **Position Scarcity** - Bonus when quality drops off
4. **Strategy Alignment** - Adjusts based on selected approach
